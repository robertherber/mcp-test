# Get started

Clone this repo - use `example-mcp.json` as a template and use it as a template with your own paths, and put it in the right mcp config file:

- Update your `claude_desktop_config.json` (if you're using Claude Desktop)
- or your cursor mcp config at `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (if you're using Cursor).

If you're using Cursor, the easiest way to restart the MCP server is to restart Cursor.
